<h1>WasteX</h1>
<p>WasteX, “where the waste product of one process becomes the raw materials
for a second process”. WasteX is used for the collection of unwanted wastes like
old papers, cardboards, plastics, metal scraps, E-waste from the customer, local
collectors and so on. The customer will receive money and earn credits by giving
the waste materials. This is similar to using pre-consumer recycling material in a
product. This represents a way of reducing waste disposal through reuse for that
which cannot be eliminated. In this way WasteX practices are high on the waste
hierarchy.</p>
